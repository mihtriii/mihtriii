## 🌟 About me
I’m a first‑year AI student with a strong interest in **Computer Vision** and **Vision‑Language Models (VLMs)**. My long‑term plan is a research‑oriented path toward an **AI PhD**, with a current focus on **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** and practical, applied VLM systems.

- 🎯 **Near‑term goals (2024–2026):**
  - Achieve **at least one A\*** conference paper by the end of my **sophomore year**.
  - Attend/participate in relevant CV/ML conferences and workshops.
- 🧭 **Research focus:** Vision‑Language Models (VLMs), Applied VLMs (retrieval, grounding, reasoning), Quantum ML for vision tasks.

## 🎓 Education
- **FPT University Ho Chi Minh City (FPTU HCM)** — BSc in **Artificial Intelligence** *(Cohort K20)*  
  *2024 – present*
  
<!-- Optionally add GPA / notable coursework here -->

---

## 💼 Experience & Activities
- **AI Research Intern** — **AITA LAB, FPTU HCM** *(2025 – present)*  
  • Early‑stage research exposure, literature review, and prototyping around CV/QML topics. *(Short bullets can be expanded as work matures.)*

- **Community** — *AI & DS Student, Campus activities*  
  • Exploring GDG on Campus / student tech communities and academic seminars.

---

## 🧪 Research Interests
- **Vision‑Language Models**: multimodal retrieval, visual grounding, instruction tuning, evaluation.
- **Applied VLMs**: deploying practical systems (edge or cloud), latency/throughput trade‑offs.
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: quantum‑enhanced models for CV, hybrid classical‑quantum training.

---

## 🏅 Competitions & Hackathons
- **AIoT on Edge Hackathon (2025)** — Recent participation; explored deploying lightweight CV/VLM components on edge platforms. *(Add results/links when available.)*
- **VOI 2024** — **Consolation Prize** (Khuyến khích).

---

## ⚙️ Skills
- **Languages**: **C++**, **Python** *(intermediate)*
- **(Growing) ML/CV Stack**: PyTorch, OpenCV, basic data handling; eager to expand into 🤗 Transformers, timm, and multimodal toolkits.
- **Quantum**: Intro Qiskit/PennyLane concepts; interest in hybrid models and quantum transfer learning.
- **Tooling**: Git/GitHub, Linux CLI, LaTeX/Overleaf (for paper writing).  

> *I prefer a learn‑by‑building approach; expect this section to grow quickly as projects land in the repo.*

---

## 📂 Featured Projects (incoming)
> I’m currently converting study notes and prototypes into public repos. Planned directions:
- **Mini‑VLM Playground** — small‑scale retrieval/grounding demos with clear benchmarks.
- **QML for Vision** — toy datasets (MNIST/CIFAR) with hybrid quantum‑classical baselines.
- **Edge‑friendly CV** — distilled/quantized models for edge inference.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration
- I’m open to collaborating on **lightweight VLM systems**, **multimodal retrieval**, or **QML‑for‑CV** baselines.  
- If you’re building an **edge‑deployable CV/VLM** demo, I’d love to contribute.

> Reach me via **email** or open an **issue** on one of my repos.
