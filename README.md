## 🌟 About me
I’m a first-year AI student passionate about **Computer Vision** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**. My long-term path targets an **AI PhD**, and I’m currently exploring **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** alongside practical, applied VLM systems.

- 🎯 **Near-term goals (2024–2026):**
  - Achieve **at least one A\*** conference paper by the end of my **sophomore year**.
  - Attend and participate in relevant CV/ML conferences and workshops.
- 🧭 **Research focus:** VLMs (retrieval, grounding, reasoning), applied VLMs, and QML for vision tasks.

## 🎓 Education
- **FPT University Ho Chi Minh City (FPTU HCM)** — BSc in **Artificial Intelligence** *(Cohort K21)*  
  *2024 – present*

<!-- Optionally add GPA / notable coursework here -->

---

## 💼 Experience & Activities
- **AI Research Intern** — **AITA LAB, FPTU HCM** *(2025 – present)*  
  • Early-stage research, literature review, prototyping, and small-scale benchmarking in CV/QML.

- **Community** — *AI & DS student, campus activities*  
  • Engaging with GDG on Campus / student tech communities and academic seminars.

---

## 🧪 Research Interests
- **Vision-Language Models**: multimodal retrieval, visual grounding, instruction tuning, evaluation.  
- **Applied VLMs**: deploying practical systems (edge/cloud), latency–throughput trade-offs.  
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: quantum-enhanced models for CV, hybrid classical-quantum training.

---

## 🏅 Competitions & Hackathons
- **AIoT on Edge Hackathon (2025)** — Recent participation; explored deploying lightweight CV/VLM components on edge platforms. *(Add results/links when available.)*
- **Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Việt Nam 2024** — **Third Prize (High School Division)**, team **T-Gardens**. [Link](https://solvefortomorrow.vn/doi-thang-giai/t-gardens)
- **VOI 2024** — **Consolation Prize** (Khuyến khích).

---

## ⚙️ Skills
- **Languages**: **C++**, **Python** *(intermediate)*  
- **ML/CV Stack (growing)**: PyTorch, OpenCV; learning 🤗 Transformers, timm, multimodal toolkits.  
- **Quantum**: Intro Qiskit/PennyLane concepts; interest in hybrid models and quantum transfer learning.  
- **Tooling**: Git/GitHub, Linux CLI, LaTeX/Overleaf.

> *I prefer a learn-by-building approach; expect this section to grow quickly as projects land in the repo.*

---

## 📂 Featured Projects (incoming)
> Converting study notes and prototypes into public repos:
- **Mini-VLM Playground** — small-scale retrieval/grounding demos with clear benchmarks.
- **QML for Vision** — hybrid quantum-classical baselines on MNIST/CIFAR.
- **Edge-friendly CV** — distilled/quantized models for edge inference.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration
- Open to collaborating on **lightweight VLM systems**, **multimodal retrieval**, or **QML-for-CV** baselines.  
- If you’re building an **edge-deployable CV/VLM** demo, I’d love to contribute.

> Reach me via **email** or open an **issue** on one of my repos.
